                <dd><p align="left">The magnetic City of Light draws visitors from around the globe who come to see iconic attractions like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe. But what travelers really fall in love with are the city's quaint cafes, vibrant markets, trendy shopping districts and unmistakable je ne sais quoi. Get lost wandering along the charming cobblestone streets, or grab a croissant and relax on the banks of the Seine for hours. If you're up for a quick daytrip, head about 15 miles southwest of the city center to the Palace of Versailles, which offers guided and self-guided tours of the estate.<a href="https://www.getyourguide.com/-l16/?cmp=ga&cq_src=google_ads&cq_cmp=6657882442&cq_con=81684568289&cq_term=paris&cq_med=&cq_plac=&cq_net=g&cq_pos=&cq_plt=gp&campaign_id=6657882442&adgroup_id=81684568289&target_id=aud-905885568122%3Akwd-11658881&loc_physical_ms=9009919&match_type=e&ad_id=495464909722&keyword=paris&ad_position=&feed_item_id=&placement=&device=c&partner_id=CD951&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1sucBhDgARIsAFoytUtwmjNDIA-rAYS2JVyyi6icWEbQwb6rjA-7pMANcedwLyNnyR9deVoaAgRtEALw_wcB">Visit Link.</a>The City of Light draws millions of visitors every year with its unforgettable ambiance. Of course, the divine cuisine and vast art collections deserve some of the credit as well. The gentle River Seine rambles through the city, flanked by stately museums, centuries-old churches, and blocks of Rococo- and Neoclassic-design architecture, further enhanced by cascading trees and glowing streetlamps. Peppering the Seine's cobbled walks and graceful bridges are impossibly chic Parisians, probably on their way to the market, cafe or cinema.

                    Containing world-class museums, fashion, cuisine and an atmosphere all its own, Paris is also a city of "many splendors," as Ernest Hemingway recalled in his memoir, "A Moveable Feast." Visit the beloved Musée d'Orsay, shop the biggest designers on the Champs Élysées or hit the boutiques in Le Marais, take in the view atop the Eiffel Tower, or even plan a day trip to Versailles Palace. But don't miss out on the simple pleasure of meandering the marvelous arrondissements (districts), or snacking on street crepes either</p></dd>

                <dd>Whether you're driving along the Road to Hana, enjoying a bird's-eye view of Maui's lush coastline from a helicopter, snorkeling with sea turtles or simply relaxing on white or black sand beaches, you'll find that this Hawaiian island is unlike any other tropical destination. Don't miss a chance to visit Haleakala National Park, which is home to one of the world's largest dormant volcanic craters.Maui is not nearly as large as the Big Island, nor is it as small as Lanai, as bustling as Oahu or as quiet as Kauai. For many Hawaii vacationers, Maui is just right – offering a taste of just about everything the Aloha State has to offer, from impressive wildlife to intriguing history and culture. While on a visit here, you can shimmy alongside professional hula dancers, golf along coastal fairways, sail down a zip line, snorkel alongside five different types of sea turtles or simply lounge along some of Hawaii's most notable beaches.

                    One of the archipelago's most popular tourism spots, Maui can be found sandwiched between the Big Island and the much tinier Molokai (which you can explore by signing up for one of the best Maui tours). Maui is divided into five distinct regions: Many travelers base themselves along the coasts of South Maui (home to the famous Wailea Beach) or West Maui, where the sands of Kaanapali Beach and the music from the Old Lahaina Luau are located. But the rest of the island should not be missed. Travel along the Road to Hana to experience East Maui's scenic coastline, explore Haleakala – the world's largest dormant volcano – in the Upcountry and discover the former tribal battlegrounds of Central Maui's Iao Valley State Park. And for a bird's-eye view of it all, reserve a spot on one of Maui's best helicopter tours. </dd>
